    <h2>activity_data_raw schema</h2>
    <h4>This schema stores the raw activity data that have still to be (partially) processed to be analyzed and merged together.</h4>
    <h2>analysis schema</h2>
    <h4>The schema "analysis" stores the results of analysis (home range, trajectories, and statistics).</h4>
      <table class="min"><th>test_home_ranges:</th><td>Table that stores the home range polygons derived from a set of possible methods. A set of fieldsis  used as metadata to identify the source data: the animal (which is considered the basic "unit" for the home range computation), the time range that is used to select locations considered in the analysis,, and the total number of locations that generated the home range (this can be modified to accept a more general SQL select statements where any criteria can be used, not just starting time and ending time; this option must be discussed to identify the best implementation to satisfy NINA's requirements). The computation method is stored in a specific (coded in a look up table) field connected to other fields where are stored the parameters (the table has generic fields "parametr_1, parameter_2, parameter_3,  parameter_4, the meaning of these parameters depend on the method and are explained in the look up tables of the method code). New parameters (e.g. parameter_5) can be added at any time. The area (in hectars) is computed and stored in the filed "area". These other fields are used to carachterize the analysis: user who performed the analysis, timestamp when the analysis was performed, and a general description. For home ranges that derive from a probability surface (e.g. kernel home range), the reference probability surface (raster) is stored. Note that the key is a serial number, therefore the same analysis can be performed twice and the results will be both stored in the database. The field obsolete_code will be supported by a function to detect obsolete analysis (checking the number of locations that originated the home range, and verifying that none of the original data is newer that the date of the analysis).</table>

The fields "parameter_1", "parameter_2", "parameter_3", "parameter_4" (described lu_tables.lu_hr_method) specify the values of the parameters (if any) used in the home range method. If a method with futher parameters is used, new "parametr_x" fileds can be added.</td></tr>

This view can be used in R to create a ltraj class with no bursts. here an example: 
get the data 
data_traj_raw <- sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT *  FROM analysis.view_ltraj_class;"); create a ltraj object 
create an ltraj object
data_traj<- as.ltraj(xy=data_traj_raw[,c("x","y")], date=as.POSIXct(data_traj_raw[,"acquisition_epoch"],  origin="1970-01-01 01:00:00"), id =data_traj_raw[,"animals_id"])
Any "where" clause can be added to "SELECT *  FROM analysis.view_ltraj_class" to limits animals (e.g. "where animals_id in (1,2,3,6,7)") or starting and ending time.
To create ltraj objces with bursts identificator, you have to use the tools.sam_traj_bursts function.</table>
