# EURODEER documentation

**In this folder you can find a set of documents that introduce, describe and document the EURODEER project**

The documents are particularly focussed on the software platform and the database. The goal is to provide project partners with the information needed to understand and use the database.
At the moment there are:

* **EURODEER user guide**  
A general introduction to the project, a review of the database content and information on how to connect with the database and perform the basic operations like data visualization and download

* **[EURODEER database dictionary](eurodeer_db_dictionary.md)**  
A description of all the main elements in the database (schemas, tables, views, foreing tables). This information is retrieved automatically from the database where the description of every object is stored (and cna be visualized in all the db interfaces (e.g. pgadmin, qgis, etc).
