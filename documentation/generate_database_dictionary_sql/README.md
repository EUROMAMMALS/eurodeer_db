 # SQL code to generate the documentation of the main database objects (schemas, tables, views)
 The code is tuned on EURODEER_DB because it exludes some specific set of tables (e.g. tables in the working schemas) and order schemas according to their relevance for the project (e.g. "main" first), but it can be easily adapted to toher db.
 Some "massages" were done on the comments of the db object to be sure the md formatting was ok (e.g. remove first and last character if they were empty spaces). The sql used for some checks and text improvement is also reported in this folder.
