EUropean ROe DEER project is an open, bottom-up network joined by more than 40 research centres and environmental institutes from 18 countries  to produce collaborative science based on knowledge and data sharing to investigate the movement ecology of European deer in their different habitats and management regimes.
The **[EURODEER User Guide](http://feurbano.github.io/eurodeer_db/documentation/eurodeer_user_guide.html)** is the most relevant document to have an introduction to **EURODEER** and **EUROMAMMALS** (that includes other species-specific networks: red deer, wild boar, European lynx, wildcat) in general.


## EURODEER GitHub repo: Docs and SQL code for db use and management

This repository contains the documentation of the EURODEER database structure and content. In addition, it stores the SQL queries and function used to maintain and update the database. It is shared among database managers, curators and users (i.e. EURODEER Project partners.

The repository is divided in subdirectories: 

* **[data_management](https://github.com/feurbano/eurodeer_db/tree/master/data_management)**: Data management (SQL code and functions for quality checks and data import, export, screening)
* **[data_analysis](https://github.com/feurbano/eurodeer_db/tree/master/data_analysis)**: Data analysis (SQL code and functions for specific analysis performed inside and outside the database)
* **[documentation](https://github.com/feurbano/eurodeer_db/tree/master/documentation)**: Documentation (Manuals to use the database and its functionalities/outputs)

While all files stored and shared in this repository are pretty specific to the EURODEER projects, in some cases can be of interest for similar projects.
