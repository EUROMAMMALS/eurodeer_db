**Code for database and data use/management/development**

This repository contains the database structure, SQL queries and documentation used to maintain and update the EURODEER database. It is shared among database managers, curators and users.

The repository is divided in subdirectories: 
* **[data_management](https://github.com/eurodeer/eurodeer_db/tree/master/data_management)**: Data management (SQL code and functions for quality checks and data import, export, screening)
* **[data_analysis](https://github.com/eurodeer/eurodeer_db/tree/master/data_analysis)**: Data analysis (SQL code and functions for specific analysis performed inside and outside the database)
* **[documentation](https://github.com/eurodeer/eurodeer_db/tree/master/documentation)**: Documentation (Manuals to use the database and its functionalities/outputs)

Particularly relevant is the [EURODEER User Guide](https://github.com/eurodeer/eurodeer_db/blob/master/documentation/eurodeer_user_guide.md).

While all files stored and shared in this repository are pretty specific to the EURODEER projects, in some cases can be of interest for similar projects.
